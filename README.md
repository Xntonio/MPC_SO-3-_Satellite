# MPC_SO-3-_Satellite

This repository includes the MATLAB Simulink simulation files for the paper "Nonlinear model predictive control of a satellite
attitude dynamics on SO(3)"

Requirments: matlab 2021b or higher

Steps to run the simulation:

Run the file: mpc_object.m
Run MPC_Satellite.slx simulation
Whenever you change the system parameters shown in the paper, please retune the control gains to get robustness against exogenous disturbances.
