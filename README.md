# MPC_SO-3-_Satellite

This repository includes the MATLAB Simulink simulation files for the paper "Model Predictive Control Based on the Generalized Bouc-Wen Model for PiezoelectricActuators in Robotic Hand WithOnly Position Measurements"

Requirments: matlab 2017b or higher

Steps to run the simulation:

Run the file: piezo_main.m
Run PiezoMPC2_17.slx simulation
Whenever you change the system parameters shown in the paper, please retune the control gains to get robustness against exogenous disturbances.
